1. permission mode: bypass permissions \ 2. settings sources: let's keep it empty \ 3. session management: importnatly we should use streaming input mode (https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agent-sdk/streaming-vs-single-mode#streaming-input-mode-recommended) - we're going to keep our own chat history in supabase (chat_sessions and chat_messages table). if the session is discontinued we can use resume to resume previous conversation \ 4. let's not worry about tools or mcp right now - leave the option empty \ 5. let's not worry about this either. \ 6. for fastify api layer, we just need streaming input pattern, not single shot. let's keep it simple - just one endpoint for this. and let's not use websocket for now. let's use the regular sse pattern. \ let's not do too much right now - let's keep it sipmle. we just want streaming input mode and be able to create a very basic chat interface for our app. keep it minimal. plan it out again please -don't code yet
